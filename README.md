# ComputerCraft Scripts

This repository contains most of my used lua scripts for [CC:Tweaked](https://tweaked.cc/).

## Install

They can be installed with following command on any computer or turtle.
Maybe some of them have special requirements you need to find out.s

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Poeschl/computercraft-scripts/main/<scriptname> <localfilename>
```

## External scripts

### A Long Time Ago - Movie

Make sure you can store files with max 3 MB on your computers. This is heavy.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dan200/ComputerCraft/master/src/main/resources/assets/computercraft/lua/treasure/dan200/alongtimeago/alongtimeago.lua alongtimeago.lua
