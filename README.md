# ComputerCraft Scripts

This repository contains most of my used lua scripts for [CC:Tweaked](https://tweaked.cc/).

## Install

They can be installed with the wget command and the raw file contents of the files here.
For an easier way there is also an installer, which allows to install any script of the repository.

To execute it, use following line:

```shell
wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Poeschl/computercraft-scripts/main/installer.lua
```

## External scripts

### A Long Time Ago - Movie

Make sure you can store files with max 3 MB on your computers. This is heavy.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dan200/ComputerCraft/master/src/main/resources/assets/computercraft/lua/treasure/dan200/alongtimeago/alongtimeago.lua alongtimeago.lua
```
